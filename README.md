### What I learned

There was nothing new that I used for this challenge. Instead, what I chose to do with this challenge is to use
the challenge as a way to get back into practice after taking a small break. Because of this, I did learn a few
things that I want to take into consideration if I were to take a break in my learning journey.

1. **It is okay to forget things**

Going back to web development practice reminded me that it is okay that I forgot some things. Practice is the key to get
better at this. But taking a break is important from time to time, especially during a learning journey.

2. **Googling is a skill that you need to practice**

I thought that I was still good at finding answers using google. Not using that skill for a while does get you rusty and of course
is a skill that you need to practice. It sounds weird, but I feel that it is important.

3. **I know more than I had thought**

I keep thinking that I do not retain knowledge that well. This challenge helped change that outlook in reminding me that I do
know more than I think. I did not need to look up how to do something or quickly google a reference. I found that I was able to
get a lot of it done on my own.

One of the other things that I was getting use to is using Figma's Developer Mode. It was a nice to have a point of reference, but to also
use it as a way to gage my approximations as well.

### Continued development

The plan is to still use the beginner challenges to practice the skills that I have been learning.
